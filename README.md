# 	Flogo-Mavlink Project

Welcome to the Flogo-Mavlink Project<br>
<br>
The goal of this project is to enable developers to access all the features of the Mavlink protocol from within the Flogo ecosystem ([Project Flogo](https://flogo.io) and [TIBCO Flogo Enterprise](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-flogo)].<br>
<br>
Quite simply, the project is a Flogo extension, creating a new palette of activities and trigger for interfacing with a Mavlink supported vehicle.  The capabilities of the extension are ever-growing, currently including:
- Arm/disarm
- Upload mission
- Start mission
- Set mode
- Issue any generic MAV_CMD type
- Listen to all events emitted by vehicle
<br>
